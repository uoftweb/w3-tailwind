        <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
        <p>
          For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic
          bread with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an
          iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm,
          cheesy loaf for Halloween.

          But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked
          to a series of rabies cases springing up around the country.

          Now I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure
          that looks good, too:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>So here is the first item in this list.</li>
          <li>In this example we're keeping the items short.</li>
          <li>Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.</li>
        </ul>

          Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look
          like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.

            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
            making it over 2000 years old.
