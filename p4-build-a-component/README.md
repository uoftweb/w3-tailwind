# Part 4: Build a Component Using Tailwind

In this part, we'll start applying what we've learned to create a "Call to Action" component that's commonly used on blog and marketing sites:

## Getting Started

Run the following to install and build CSS for Tailwind:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

This should create a file called `out/compiled.css` that is referenced in the `index.html` file.

We'll build out the component from scratch in the workshop, so follow along as best you can :smile:.
